# ShoppingTracker

## ShoppingTracker (CS50 final project)

### Improve your shopping experience with ShoppingTracker ;)
ShoppingTracker is an Android app developed with C# and the Xamarin framework which helps you to plan, organize and keep track all of your shopping needs.
With ShoppingTracker you can create wonderful shopping lists and templates, to prepare and plan your future shoppings and take care so that you don't forget anything when you're getting your daily or weekly needs
On top of that the app creates a log of your done shopping data, inserting it into a shopping history, to have a fast overview over past shoppings and shopping costs.

### Features:
#### Create one-time shopping list and shopping list templates for re-use ("Create"-tab)
1. Create templates which can be used for shopping. It is possible to edit already created templates by adding or removing items. After editing a previously created template, it is possible to overwrite it with its newer version. Created templates are saved to the local device.
Unsaved lists can be used in the current app session.

#### Shopping experience ("Shopping"-tab)
2. Using one-time lists when processing from create list screen or loading previously created shopping list templates into the shopping view when clicking on the "load list button" allows to easily keep track of the shopping progress during shopping by checking off already gathered items.
Checked off items get marked with a green check mark after tapping them in the list.

3. With a click on the "bill button" a photo of the bill can be attached to the list. When clicking on the "process list button" additonal information like location and total cost can be added.
A click on "finish shopping" in the "process list button" sets the current or an individual date and saves the whole data set to the history.

#### History data ("History"-tab)
4. Exploring saved history data related to past shopping with attached shopping list, photo of bill and additional information.

#### Settings
5. Possible to delete unused shopping list templates and clear history data
