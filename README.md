### ShoppingTracker - CS50 final project
ShoppingTracker is an Android app developed with C# and Xamarin, which helps you to organize and track all of your shopping needs.
With ShoppingTracker you can create wonderful shopping lists, to take care that you don't forget anything during your daily or weekly shopping
and log your done shopping to history.

#### Features:
1. You can create templates, which you can use for shopping. It is possible to edit already created templates and overwrite existing one.
It is possible too to create one-time shopping list, which get not saved. The created templates are saved to the local device.

2. With your created shopping list, you can start shopping and check off your items, so that you can keep track of your shopping progress easily.
When you got all items you need, you can save your current shopping with additional information like total costs, location and shopping date to the shopping history.
The data saved to the history is stored in a SQLite database file locally on the device.

3. Now you can look up your past shoppings in the shopping history, to keep track of your costs and previously shopped items.

#### Planned features:
For further development are several features planned. For example filtering shopping history data, adding geolocations as locations to the shopping history with the Google Places API or
adding photos of bills.
